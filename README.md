# CFG-JS-MUSIC-PROJECT
Code First Girls Kickstarter 8 week JS course final group project

Coding kickstarter course running from October to December 2023.
We were put into groups for projects to showcase the skills we had covered.
I joined the music group.
Our team meeting decided on a web app that created a personalised festive playlist based on user preferences.

Our success criteria was to make a web app that:
- gets input from the user on a webpage
- Makes changes to the html/css using JS
- Uses an event to trigger a change to the wepage

Bonus success criteria:
- Add html elements ot the webpage using the DOM
- Remove html elements from the webpage using the DOM
- Research and use other DOM events such as onmouseover
- Use arrays/loops and or conditional logic in JS
